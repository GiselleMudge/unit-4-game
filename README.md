# unit-4-game
the harder fun and interactive game attempt.  

INSTRUCTIONS: 

1) CHOOSE YOUR HERO. You will represent this character in this blood sport
2) CHOOSE YOUR ENEMY. 
3) FIGHT TO THE DEATH. No mercies are granted in this game. You only have the option to hit the reset button on the bottom of the page


**Please note the math is off when the attacks are made to the 2nd and 3rd defenders, still trying to correct where the subtractions are going wrong. Styling is 70% complete, would have used a jumbotron instead of jumping to a container. Otherwise I would have been completely satisfied with this game**
